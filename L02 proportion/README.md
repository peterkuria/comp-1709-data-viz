# Bar Charts, Histogram

Bar chart is for a single/one series comparison while histogram is for distribution(usu for an array or a very long list)

## Histogram

 Like bar charts, histograms tend to show distribution by grouping segments together. Examples of this might be age groups, or scores on a test. Rather than showing every single age a group might be, maybe you just show people from 20-25, 25-30... and so on. 

For plt.hist, you first put in all of the values, then you specify into what "bins" or containers you will place the data into. In our case, we are plotting a bunch of ages, and we want to display them in terms of increments of 10 years. We give the bars a width of 0.8, but you can choose something else if you want to make the bars thicker, or thinner.

## Scatter Plot
Scatter plots are usually used to compare two variables, 
or three if you are plotting in 3 dimensions, looking for 
correlation or groups.
