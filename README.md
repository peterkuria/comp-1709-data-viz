# COMP1709 - INFORMATION VISUALISATION

These are my class and study notes for the BSc. In Computing, Greenwich University, Data Visualisation course.

This involves visual data exploration and /or explanation

Visual data exploration involves: 
- data cleaning
- data wrangling
- visualisation
  
Data visualisation helps us to understand the data/statistics 

## Data visualization tools

The main reason we prefer Python/ R over Excel, for data visualisation is because, in the latter, Xls, data is not transferable.
In python we use libraries like MatPlotLip and Pandas for DV.
